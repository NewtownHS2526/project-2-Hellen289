        <p class="text-green-600">Spiders hunt in many ways including ambush predation and complex webs. The insects land on there webs and they are unable to free themselves from it. They ambush the insects by waiting for there prey to come. Some of the spiders are active hunting where the spiders are really fast. Some spiders are jumping were they leap on there prey to capture it. A spiders diet is that it primiarily consists of insects and other invertebrates, though some species econsume small vertebrates. There digestion is they liquefy it externally by innjecting digestive enzymes and then suck up the resulting liquid. </p>
